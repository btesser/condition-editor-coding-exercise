# condition-view-coding-exercise
A Coding Exercise for UI Developers

# Introduction

Many capabilites of Salsify are built around filtered sets of products.  Products at salsify consist of properties and their values.  Properties can be of several types.

In order to create filtered sets of products in Salsify we have created a condition editor.  This editor is used to build a filter that Salsify applies to the full set of products.  The result is displayed _live_ as filters are added.

Due to the differences in property data types, not all operations apply to all properties.

In this exercise we would like to build a user interface that creates a filter and causes a list of products to update to reflect the results.

# Specification

## Data

We have provided you with a `datastore` with all the data you need to build your condition editor.
